# Mark-Down-Blog
This is a responsive Markdown web application that demonstrates the use of CRUD operatioind.
You can create a new article, read an article, update/edit an article and delete an article with Nodejs/Expressjs on the backend, 
MongoDB is the database used and EJS template engine used to display backend data on the client side.

Please do not mind my poor UI I am just the backend guy lol......
